============================================================

*   Bugfix: Ensure dependencies are handled properly when using the
    combine plugin. (Issue #120).
*   Bugfix: Ensure external urls are encoded properly. (Issue #158).

    -   **BREAKING**:  While this change will correct the weird encoding
        behavior, this also changes the way ``xxx_url`` macros work.
    -   Do not encode the url bases (``base_url``, ``media_url``). Only
        the path component needs to be encoded.

*   Bugfix: Fix subfolders for root paths on windows. (Issue #167).

    -   Ensure that subfolders for ``layout_root``, ``content_root``,
        ``media_root`` and ``deploy_root`` works reliably
        on windows. Use ``fully_expanded_path`` for all path components.

*   Bugfix: Fixed ``raise_exceptions`` command line parameter handling.
*   Better exception handling. (Issue #204)

        for raising exceptions on error.
    -   Traceback is available in the ``verbose`` mode
