More advanced topics
====================

If you have read and understood all basic topics covered in
{% for res in site.content.walk_resources_grouped_by_basic()|reverse %}
[{{ res.slug|capitalize|replace("-"," ") }}]({{ res.full_url }}) 
{% endfor %}
then you are ready for some more advanced features. They are explained in
the same way as the basic part, building on the knowledge of the previous,
so it is recommended that you follow them in the listed order.


{# List all resources from a group, sort them by index and list their tags. #}

{% for res in resource.node.walk_resources_sorted_by_learning_order() %}
{{ loop.index }}. \
    [{{ res.slug|capitalize|replace("-"," ") }}]({{ res.full_url }}) \
    {% if res.name == "overview.html" %}*(this file)*{% endif %} \
{#
   Sometimes you'll have to add HTML tags to a Markdown file for styling
   or adding some special features, and Markdown is OK with that.
#}
<span class="tags">tags: 
{% for tag in res.meta.tags %}
{#
   After wring the tag name, check if that is the last tag in the list. If
   it is, don't append the comma at the end.
#}
{{ tag }}{% if tag != res.meta.tags[-1] %},{% endif %} 
{% endfor %}
</span>
{% endfor %}
