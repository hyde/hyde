{# In-file metadata. Supplements data from the site's configuration file 
   and node (folder) level data in "meta.yaml" files.

   Use the AutoExtendPlugin to extend templates from metadata. In this

There and back again
====================

This template was created to look at its code. So you should spend about
5% of your time looking at the web from the outside and the other 95%
tinkering with things under the hood.

The template is not perfect nor does it contain the best practices. It
is not even consistent. It is designed to help you with the learning
process. If you follow the steps below, you'll get a pretty good picture of
how things work. Every step adds some new features and builds upon the
previous one.


1. Site structure and configuration file
----------------------------------------

The site is made of two folders and a [Hyde configuration][hyde_config]
file. The folders are _content_ and _layout_.

_content_ contains all your page content, blog articles, pictures and
resources like CSS and JavaScript. Everything that is unique is here.

_layout_ contains templates and macros. Everything that you'll want to
reuse is here.


2. Jinja2 template
------------------

_base.j2_ is a very short and simple Jinja2 template. This way you can
concentrate on some of the basic features. Notice meta and context
variables invocation inside curly braces, dynamic media path generation
and running all content through the Markdown filter.

_macros.j2_ contains a macro for generating the main menu.

For more information or to try something new, visit the extensive [Jinja2
documentation][jinja2_docs].


3. Content
----------

Look at the three files in this order: _index.html_, _what-next.html_
and _about.html_.

_Index_ extends the base layout in the classic Jinja way and fills the
content block with some simple Markdown data.

_What next_ goes a step furher. It introduces the in-file metadata that
plugins will use to extend and fill the layout. It also uses some new
Markdown features.

_About_ has a _default_block_ metadata and mixes Markdown content with
Jinja templates.
