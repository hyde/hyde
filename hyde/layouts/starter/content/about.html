About
=====

This beginner's tutorial was created by [Merlin RebroviÄ‡][0] for the
[Hyde project][1]. It is included in Hyde as a layout named _starter_.
If you have a [default Hyde installation][2], all you have to do is
write:

    hyde -s folder_name create -l starter

To build and serve the template, type:

    cd folder_name
    hyde gen
    hyde serve

To check for the newest version, download it separately, report a bug
or contribute, please visit Hyde Starter Kit's [GitHub page][3].
