    Each page should be tagged with a language using `language` meta
    data. Each page should also have an UUID stored in `uuid` meta
    data. Pages with different languages but the same UUID will be
    considered a translation of each other.

    For example, consider that you have the following content tree:
       - `en/`
       - `fr/`

    In `en/meta.yaml`, you set `language: en` and in `fr/meta.yaml`, you
    set `language: fr`. In `en/my-first-page.html`, you put something like
    this::
         -------
         uuid: page1
         -------
         My first page

     And in `fr/ma-premiere-page.html`, you put something like this::
         -------
         uuid: page1
         -------
         Ma premi√®re page

    You'll get a `translations` attribute attached to the resource
    with the list of resources that are a translation of this one.
