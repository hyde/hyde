Version 0.8.9

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/hyde/hyde.svg?branch=master

Overview
========

`Hyde starter kit`_ by `merlinrebrovic`_ is a really nice way to get started
with hyde.

`Hyde layout for bootstrap`_ by `auzigog`_ is also a good alternative if you
like Twitter's `bootstrap framework`_.

You can also take a look at `Hyde Powered Websites`_ for inspiration and
reference.

Currently hyde is only supported on python 2.7.x.  Python 3.x support is in
progress, thanks to `jonafato`_.

Hyde is not actively maintained.

Mailing List:  `hyde-dev`_ on google groups.
IRC: #hyde on freenode


Installation
------------

To get the latest released version:

::

    pip install hyde

For the current trunk:

::

    pip install -e git://github.com/hyde/hyde.git#egg=hyde

Creating a new hyde site
------------------------

The following command:

::

        hyde -s ~/test_site create

will create a new hyde site using the test layout.

Generating the hyde site
------------------------

::

        cd ~/test_site
        hyde gen

Serving the website
-------------------

::

        cd ~/test_site
        hyde serve
        open http://localhost:8080

Publishing the website
----------------------

::

        cd ~/test_site
        hyde publish -p github


Hyde supports extensible publishers.

Github
~~~~~~~

The hyde documentation is published to github pages using this command with
the following configuration:

::

        publisher:
            github:
                type: hyde.ext.publishers.dvcs.Git
                path: ../hyde.github.com
                url: git@github.com:hyde/hyde.github.com.git

.. Note:: Currently, the initial path must have clone of the repository
          already in place for this command to work.

PyFS
~~~~~~~

Hyde also has a publisher that acts as a frontend to the awesome
`PyFS library`_ (thanks to `rfk`_). Here are a few configuration
options for some PyFS backends:

::

        publisher:
            zip:
                type: hyde.ext.publishers.pyfs.PyFS
                url: zip://~/deploy/hyde/docs.zip
            s3:
                type: hyde.ext.publishers.pyfs.PyFS
                url: s3://hyde/docs
            sftp:
                type: hyde.ext.publishers.pyfs.PyFS
                url: sftp:hydeuser:hydepassword@hydedocs.org

.. Note:: PyFS is not installed with hyde. In order to use the
          PyFS publisher, you need to install pyfs separately.

Any PyFS dependencies (Example: `boto` for S3 publishing)
need to be installed separately as well.

::

        pip install fs
        pip install boto

To get additional help on PyFS backends, you can run the following
command once PyFS is installed:

::

        fsls --listopeners

A brief list of features
--------------------------

1. Evented Plugins: The Plugin hooks allow plugins to listen to events
   that occur during different times in the lifecycle and respond
   accordingly.
2. Metadata: Hyde now supports hierarchical metadata. You can specify
   and override variables at the site, node or the page level and access
   them in the templates.
3. Organization: The sorter, grouper and tagger plugins provide rich
   meta-data driven organizational capabilities to hyde sites.
4. Publishing: Hyde sites can be published to variety of targets including
   github pages, Amazon S3 & SFTP.
